# HerdShare — Regional Targeting & Geographic Intelligence Guide

## Purpose

This guide provides a framework for identifying, prioritizing, and targeting geographic regions for rancher lead generation based on supply density, logistical efficiency, and market opportunity.

**Goal:** Focus outreach efforts on regions with the highest concentration of independent ranchers and best proximity to HerdShare infrastructure.

## Step 1: Map HerdShare Infrastructure

### Current & Planned Assets

Before targeting ranchers, know where your infrastructure is or will be.

#### Map These Locations:

**Warehouse/Distribution Hubs:**
- Current operating hubs
- Planned hubs (next 6-12 months)
- Hub capacity and throughput

**Processing Partners:**
- USDA-inspected facilities you work with
- Custom exempt processors (if applicable)
- Processing capacity (head per week/month)

**Transportation Corridors:**
- Major highways and freight routes
- Livestock hauler availability
- Seasonal access issues (snow, flooding)

---

### Example Infrastructure Map

| Hub Name | Location | Status | Processing Partner | Capacity (Head/Month) |
|----------|----------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Billings Hub | Billings, MT | Active | Montana Processing Co. | 500 |
| Denver Hub | Denver, CO | Planned (Q2 2026) | Rocky Mountain Meats | 800 |
| Omaha Hub | Omaha, NE | Active | Heartland Processors | 1,200 |

---

## Step 2: Define Target Radiuses

### Distance Zones

For each hub, define concentric targeting zones based on freight economics.

#### Zone Classification:

**Primary Zone: 0-100 miles**
- **Economics:** Ideal freight cost ($0.10-0.15/mile/head)
- **Transit time:** 1-2 hours
- **Priority:** Highest
- **Target:** 60-70% of rancher partnerships from this zone

**Secondary Zone: 101-150 miles**
- **Economics:** Acceptable freight cost ($0.15-0.20/mile/head)
- **Transit time:** 2-3 hours
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Target:** 25-30% of partnerships

**Tertiary Zone: 151-200 miles**
- **Economics:** Marginal freight cost ($0.20-0.25/mile/head)
- **Transit time:** 3-4 hours
- **Priority:** Low (only high-volume ranchers)
- **Target:** 5-10% of partnerships

**Beyond 200 miles:**
- **Economics:** Prohibitive for most operations
- **Priority:** Do not pursue unless exceptional volume (500+ head annually)

---

### Zone Mapping Process

1. **Use mapping software** (Google Maps, ArcGIS, QGIS)
2. **Draw radius circles** around each hub (100mi, 150mi, 200mi)
3. **Overlay county boundaries** (easier to target by county than exact miles)
4. **Identify target counties** in each zone

---

## Step 3: Overlay Cattle Density Data

### Where to Find Cattle Inventory Data

#### USDA NASS (National Agricultural Statistics Service)
- **Source:** [https://www.nass.usda.gov/](https://www.nass.usda.gov/)
- **Data:** County-level cattle and calf inventory
- **Format:** Published annually in "Cattle Inventory" report
- **What to look for:** Counties with 10,000+ head (indicates commercial density)

#### State Agricultural Census
- **Source:** State Departments of Agriculture
- **Data:** Farm count, average herd size, total inventory
- **Format:** State-specific reports (varies by state)

#### Auction Market Locations
- **Source:** Livestock auction barn websites, industry directories
- **Logic:** High auction activity = high rancher density
- **What to map:** Major auction facilities within target zones

---

### Cattle Density Analysis

#### High-Density Indicators:
✅ County inventory >20,000 head
✅ Multiple auction markets in county
✅ Average farm size 50-200 head (commercial, not hobby or mega-ranch)
✅ Independent operations (not dominated by 1-2 large corporate ranches)

#### Low-Density Indicators:
❌ County inventory <5,000 head
❌ Dominated by feedlots or large corporate operations
❌ Primarily dairy (not beef cattle)
❌ Hobby farms (<20 head average)

---

### Example Cattle Density Map (Montana)

| County | Cattle Inventory | Avg Farm Size | Auction Markets | Density Score |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Dawson | 48,000 | 120 head | 2 (Glendive, Sidney) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ High |
| Custer | 32,000 | 95 head | 1 (Miles City) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High |
| Yellowstone | 18,000 | 60 head | 3 (Billings area) | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium |
| Gallatin | 12,000 | 35 head | 1 (Bozeman) | ⭐⭐ Low (hobby farms) |

**Prioritize:** Dawson and Custer counties (high density, commercial scale)

---

## Step 4: Assess Rancher Independence

### Corporate Consolidation Risk

Some regions are dominated by vertically integrated operations (not your target).

#### How to Assess Independence:

**Research Indicators:**
- State cattlemen association membership lists (independent ranchers join these)
- Auction market consignor diversity (many small consignors = independent operations)
- Land ownership patterns (family-owned vs. corporate-owned)
- Local ag extension agent feedback ("mostly family operations" vs. "few big players")

**Red Flags (Low Independence):**
❌ Region dominated by 1-2 mega-ranches (10,000+ head each)
❌ Heavy feedlot concentration (backgrounding/finishing operations, not cow-calf)
❌ Vertically integrated beef brands (corporate ranches supplying their own retail)

**Green Flags (High Independence):**
✅ Diverse ownership (100+ ranches in county, not 5 big ones)
✅ Strong local auction market participation
✅ Active state/regional cattlemen association chapters
✅ Mix of small and mid-sized operations (50-300 head)

---

## Step 5: Score & Rank Regions

### Regional Priority Scoring Matrix

Score each target region (county or multi-county cluster) on five factors:

| Factor | Weight | Score (1-5) |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Cattle Density** | 25% | County inventory, auction activity |
| **Proximity to Hub** | 30% | Average distance to HerdShare hub |
| **Rancher Independence** | 20% | % independent vs. corporate |
| **Processing Access** | 15% | USDA facility proximity |
| **Market Conditions** | 10% | Feed costs, drought, pricing volatility |

**Formula:**
```
Regional Score = (Cattle Density × 0.25) + (Proximity × 0.30) + (Independence × 0.20) + (Processing × 0.15) + (Market Conditions × 0.10)
```

---

### Scoring Guide

#### 1. Cattle Density (1-5)
- **5:** County inventory >30,000 head, 3+ auction markets
- **4:** Inventory 20,000-30,000 head, 2 auction markets
- **3:** Inventory 10,000-20,000 head, 1 auction market
- **2:** Inventory 5,000-10,000 head
- **1:** Inventory <5,000 head

#### 2. Proximity to Hub (1-5)
- **5:** Average rancher distance 0-60 miles from hub
- **4:** Average distance 61-100 miles
- **3:** Average distance 101-150 miles
- **2:** Average distance 151-200 miles
- **1:** Average distance >200 miles

#### 3. Rancher Independence (1-5)
- **5:** 90%+ independent family operations
- **4:** 70-90% independent
- **3:** 50-70% independent
- **2:** 30-50% independent (some corporate presence)
- **1:** <30% independent (corporate dominated)

#### 4. Processing Access (1-5)
- **5:** USDA processor within 50 miles, high capacity
- **4:** Processor within 100 miles
- **3:** Processor within 150 miles
- **2:** Processor 150-200 miles
- **1:** No accessible USDA processor

#### 5. Market Conditions (1-5)
- **5:** Strong local demand, stable feed costs, no drought
- **4:** Favorable conditions
- **3:** Neutral conditions
- **2:** Mild headwinds (drought, high feed costs)
- **1:** Severe headwinds (major drought, collapsed local market)

---

### Example Regional Scoring

**Region: Dawson County, MT (Billings Hub)**

| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Cattle Density | 5 | 48,000 head, 2 auction markets |
| Proximity to Hub | 4 | Avg 85 miles from Billings |
| Rancher Independence | 5 | 95% independent family ranches |
| Processing Access | 5 | Montana Processing Co. in Billings (60 miles) |
| Market Conditions | 3 | Moderate drought, but stable demand |

**Weighted Score:**
```
(5 × 0.25) + (4 × 0.30) + (5 × 0.20) + (5 × 0.15) + (3 × 0.10) = 4.45
```

**Priority Tier:** **Tier 1 (Top Priority)**

---

## Step 6: Launch Outreach in Top Regions

### Regional Outreach Strategy

Once you've scored and ranked regions, launch systematically.

#### Phase 1: Tier 1 Regions (Score 4.0+)
- **Timeline:** Immediate launch
- **Lead target:** 100-150 leads per region
- **Outreach intensity:** High (20-30 calls/week)
- **Goal:** Onboard 5-10 ranchers in first 90 days

#### Phase 2: Tier 2 Regions (Score 3.0-3.9)
- **Timeline:** Launch after 60 days in Tier 1 regions
- **Lead target:** 50-100 leads per region
- **Outreach intensity:** Medium (10-15 calls/week)
- **Goal:** Onboard 3-5 ranchers in 90 days

#### Phase 3: Tier 3 Regions (Score 2.0-2.9)
- **Timeline:** Opportunistic (only if capacity allows)
- **Lead target:** 25-50 leads
- **Outreach intensity:** Low (email-first approach)
- **Goal:** Onboard 1-2 ranchers

**Do NOT pursue regions scoring <2.0** (logistically or economically unviable)

---

## Regional Intelligence Gathering

### Before Launching Outreach in a New Region:

#### 1. Talk to County Extension Agents
- Call county ag extension office
- Introduce HerdShare as a buyer (not competitor)
- Ask: "Who are the top 10 commercial cattle operations in your county?"
- Request introductions or referrals

#### 2. Visit Local Auction Markets
- Attend 1-2 auctions in person
- Observe consignor frequency and lot sizes
- Collect printed sale catalogs (consignor names and contact info)
- Introduce yourself to auction staff (potential referral source)

#### 3. Join Regional Cattlemen Association Chapter
- Attend local chapter meetings
- Network with ranchers in informal settings
- Sponsor local events (builds credibility)

#### 4. Research Local Market Conditions
- Check recent drought monitor data (droughtmonitor.unl.edu)
- Review local hay and feed prices
- Understand regional challenges (wildfire, water access, etc.)
- Tailor messaging to local pain points

---

## Multi-Region Expansion Strategy

### Year 1: Hub-by-Hub Expansion

**Don't try to target everywhere at once.** Focus on one hub at a time.

#### Example Timeline:

**Q1 2026: Billings Hub Region**
- Target: Dawson, Custer, Yellowstone counties (MT)
- Goal: Onboard 15 ranchers
- Lead gen: 200 leads sourced

**Q2 2026: Omaha Hub Region**
- Target: Holt, Antelope, Madison counties (NE)
- Goal: Onboard 12 ranchers
- Lead gen: 150 leads sourced

**Q3 2026: Denver Hub Region (New Hub Launch)**
- Target: Weld, Morgan, Logan counties (CO)
- Goal: Onboard 10 ranchers
- Lead gen: 125 leads sourced

**Total Year 1:** 37 ranchers onboarded across 3 hub regions

---

## Geographic Clustering Strategy

### Prioritize Rancher Clusters

When possible, onboard multiple ranchers in close proximity.

#### Why Clustering Matters:
- **Freight efficiency:** One truck can pick up from 2-3 nearby ranches
- **Referral momentum:** Neighboring ranchers talk to each other
- **Processing coordination:** Easier to batch process from same region

#### How to Identify Clusters:
1. Map all Tier 1 leads by exact location (Google My Maps or GIS software)
2. Identify 3+ ranchers within 20-mile radius
3. Prioritize outreach to these clusters
4. Mention local partners during outreach ("We're working with 3 ranchers in your area already")

---

## State-Specific Targeting Priorities

### Top States for Independent Cattle Ranchers

Based on USDA data and rancher independence:

| State | Total Cattle Inventory | Avg Herd Size | Independence Level | Priority |
|-------|----------------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Montana** | 2.6M head | 150 head | Very High (85%+ independent) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Nebraska** | 6.8M head | 180 head | High (75% independent) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **South Dakota** | 3.9M head | 140 head | Very High (80% independent) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Wyoming** | 1.3M head | 120 head | Very High (90% independent) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Colorado** | 2.7M head | 100 head | Medium (60% independent) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Kansas** | 6.4M head | 200 head | Medium (feedlot heavy) | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Oklahoma** | 5.3M head | 90 head | High (70% independent) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Texas** | 13.1M head | Highly variable | Mixed (regional pockets) | ⭐⭐⭐ |

**Focus on Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming for highest concentration of independent operations.**

## Regional Performance Tracking

### Track by Region (Monthly):

| Region | Leads Sourced | Contacted | Onboarded | Avg Distance | Cost/Lead | Conversion Rate |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| Dawson County, MT | 120 | 95 | 8 | 82 mi | $18 | 8.4% |
| Holt County, NE | 85 | 68 | 5 | 95 mi | $22 | 7.4% |

**Use this data to refine targeting strategy over time.**

---

## Common Regional Targeting Mistakes

### ❌ Don't:
- Target everywhere at once (spread too thin)
- Ignore freight economics (200+ miles = bad unit economics)
- Overlook corporate consolidation (wasted effort on inaccessible ranchers)
- Forget seasonal access (some regions unreachable in winter)
- Rely solely on population density (cattle density ≠ human density)

### ✅ Do:
- Focus on one region at a time (master it before expanding)
- Prioritize proximity (80% of partnerships within 100 miles)
- Research rancher independence before sourcing leads
- Talk to local ag extension agents (ground truth your assumptions)
- Track regional performance (double down on what works)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Map your current/planned hubs** (locations, capacity, processing partners)
2. **Score 5-10 target regions** using the framework above
3. **Select your Tier 1 region** (highest score, launch immediately)
4. **Source 100-150 leads** from that region using [Lead Generation Playbook](../playbooks/LEAD_GENERATION_PLAYBOOK.md)
5. **Launch outreach** using [Phone](../scripts/PHONE_OUTREACH_GUIDE.md) and [Email Scripts](../scripts/EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md)
6. **Track regional metrics** and refine targeting quarterly
