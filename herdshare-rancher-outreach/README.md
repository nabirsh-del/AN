# HerdShare — Rancher Lead Generation & Outreach System

## Overview

This repository contains the complete lead generation and outreach system for identifying, contacting, and onboarding independent U.S. cattle ranchers to HerdShare's direct supply platform.

**HerdShare is supply infrastructure, not a marketplace.** We give independent ranchers predictable demand, transparent pricing, and relief from commodity-driven middlemen.

## Target Rancher Profile (ICP)

### ✅ WHO WE TARGET

- **Independent cattle ranchers** (not vertically integrated corporate operations)
- **Small to mid-sized operations**
- Ranchers selling into:
  - Auction markets
  - Local buyers
  - Regional processors
- Located **60–150 miles** from current/planned warehouse hubs
- Open to contracted supply and long-term relationships

### ❌ WHO WE DO NOT TARGET

- Feedlot conglomerates
- Corporate-owned ranches
- Branded DTC meat companies
- Hobby farms without commercial scale

## Core Value Proposition

**We are a reliable buyer and demand partner.**

### Key Messages to Ranchers:
- Direct access to institutional demand
- Transparent pricing and volumes
- No retail, no marketing burden
- Respect for rancher autonomy
- Long-term supply relationships

**DO NOT** pitch "tech" or "platforms." Position HerdShare as infrastructure that reduces exposure to volatile spot markets.

## Hard Constraints

⚠️ **CRITICAL RULES:**

- **DO NOT** automate spam outreach
- **DO NOT** use influencer tactics
- **DO NOT** promise prices before understanding costs
- **DO NOT** frame this as "disrupting" ranchers
- **DO NOT** use venture jargon

**This is relationship-first outreach. Quality over quantity.**

---

## Success Metrics

Track weekly:
- Ranchers contacted
- Conversations held
- Ranchers onboarded
- Average distance to hub
- Cost per onboarded rancher
- Retention after first delivery

Target: **10-15 quality conversations per week → 2-3 onboarded ranchers per month per region**

---

## Contact & Support

This system is designed to be:
- **Repeatable**: Follow the playbook
- **Scalable**: Expand region by region
- **Respectful**: Rancher-first approach
- **Measurable**: Track everything
