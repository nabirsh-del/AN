# HerdShare — Lead Scoring Framework

## Purpose

This framework provides a standardized method to score and prioritize rancher leads from 1 (lowest priority) to 5 (highest priority).

**Goal:** Focus outreach time on the ranchers most likely to become long-term HerdShare supply partners.

---

## Scoring Dimensions

Each lead is scored across **5 dimensions**. The final score is the **average** of all five.

```
Final Score = (Throughput + Proximity + Sales Channel + Operation Type + Responsiveness) / 5
```

Round to nearest 0.5 (e.g., 3.2 → 3.0, 3.8 → 4.0)

---

## Dimension 1: Estimated Throughput (Annual Head Count)

**What we're measuring:** Volume potential and operational scale.

| Score | Annual Head Count | Rationale |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| **5** | 200+ head | High volume, strong commercial operation |
| **4** | 100-199 head | Solid mid-sized operation |
| **3** | 50-99 head | Viable commercial scale |
| **2** | 20-49 head | Small but potentially growing |
| **1** | <20 head | Hobby scale, low priority |

**How to estimate:**
- Auction records (lot sizes × frequency)
- Herd size mentioned in association directories
- Direct ask during initial conversation
- County extension agent intel

**Notes:**
- A rancher selling 50 head today may scale to 150 next year—don't disqualify small operations entirely
- Focus on trajectory, not just current volume

---

## Dimension 2: Proximity to HerdShare Hub

**What we're measuring:** Logistical feasibility and freight cost efficiency.

| Score | Distance from Hub/Processor | Rationale |
|-------|----------------------------|-----------|
| **5** | 0-60 miles | Ideal freight economics |
| **4** | 61-100 miles | Strong logistical fit |
| **3** | 101-150 miles | Acceptable, manageable costs |
| **2** | 151-200 miles | Marginal, only if high volume |
| **1** | 200+ miles | Logistically challenging |

**How to measure:**
- Use Google Maps or routing software (ranch address → hub address)
- Consider road quality and accessibility (paved vs. gravel)
- Account for seasonal access issues (flood zones, mountain passes)

**Notes:**
- A 150-mile rancher selling 200 head may be better than a 50-mile rancher selling 30 head
- Proximity matters most when volumes are similar

---

## Dimension 3: Current Sales Channel

**What we're measuring:** Openness to alternative buyers and contract flexibility.

| Score | Current Sales Channel | Rationale |
|-------|----------------------|-----------|
| **5** | Spot auction (no contracts) | Highest flexibility, seeking alternatives |
| **4** | Local buyer (informal relationship) | Open to diversification |
| **3** | Mixed (auction + some contracts) | Willing to split allocations |
| **2** | Mostly contracted (1-2 buyers) | Limited availability |
| **1** | Fully contracted/exclusive | Not available (respect existing commitments) |

**How to assess:**
- Ask directly: "How do you currently sell your cattle?"
- Observe auction participation frequency
- Listen for frustration with current channels (pricing volatility, buyer reliability)

**Notes:**
- Ranchers frustrated with auctions are ideal prospects
- Do NOT poach ranchers from existing contracts—it's unethical and damages reputation

---

## Dimension 4: Operation Type & Independence

**What we're measuring:** Fit with HerdShare's independent rancher focus.

| Score | Operation Type | Rationale |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **5** | Independent family ranch (owner-operator) | Perfect ICP fit |
| **4** | Independent LLC/partnership (small group) | Good fit, aligned incentives |
| **3** | Ranch manager (reports to absentee owner) | Possible, but decision-making may be slower |
| **2** | Part of small regional cooperative | Mixed—may have other obligations |
| **1** | Corporate subsidiary / vertically integrated | Not target profile |

**How to assess:**
- Review business structure (listed on websites, association directories)
- Ask: "Tell me about your operation—are you owner-operated?"
- Look for red flags: "Regional Director" titles, corporate parent companies

**Notes:**
- Owner-operators have decision-making authority and aligned incentives
- Corporate operations often have procurement teams and rigid processes (not ideal fit)

---

## Dimension 5: Responsiveness & Engagement

**What we're measuring:** Likelihood of conversion based on initial interactions.

| Score | Responsiveness | Rationale |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **5** | Answers phone, asks questions, expresses interest | Ready to engage |
| **4** | Returns calls within 24-48 hours, open to conversation | Interested but busy |
| **3** | Slow to respond but eventually engages | Cautious, needs nurturing |
| **2** | Minimal engagement, vague interest | Low priority follow-up |
| **1** | No response after 3+ attempts | Deprioritize (revisit in 6 months) |

**How to assess:**
- Track initial outreach response time
- Note quality of conversation (engaged vs. distracted)
- Observe question-asking (curious ranchers = higher intent)

**Notes:**
- Responsiveness often correlates with openness to change
- Non-responsive ranchers aren't necessarily uninterested—timing matters
- Re-score after 2-3 months if situation changes

| **Final Score** | **1.6 → 1.5** | **Deprioritize—not a fit at this time** |

---

## Prioritization Strategy

### Score-Based Outreach Priority

| Score Range | Priority Level | Action |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **4.5 - 5.0** | 🔥 **Tier 1: Immediate** | Phone call within 48 hours → In-person visit if interested |
| **3.5 - 4.4** | 🟡 **Tier 2: High** | Phone call within 1 week → Email follow-up |
| **2.5 - 3.4** | 🟢 **Tier 3: Medium** | Email outreach → Phone follow-up if responsive |
| **1.5 - 2.4** | ⚪ **Tier 4: Low** | Bulk email → Revisit in 3-6 months |
| **1.0 - 1.4** | ⚫ **Tier 5: Deprioritize** | Archive, do not pursue |

---

## Weekly Outreach Allocation (Time Budget)

**Assume 20 hours/week for outreach:**

| Priority Tier | Time Allocation | Expected Activity |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Tier 1 (4.5-5.0) | 50% (10 hrs) | 8-10 deep conversations, 2-3 in-person visits |
| Tier 2 (3.5-4.4) | 30% (6 hrs) | 15-20 phone calls, 10-15 email follow-ups |
| Tier 3 (2.5-3.4) | 15% (3 hrs) | 20-30 emails, 5-10 phone follow-ups |
| Tier 4 (1.5-2.4) | 5% (1 hr) | Bulk email campaigns |

**Do not spend time on Tier 5.**

---

## Dynamic Re-Scoring

Scores are **not static**. Re-score leads when:

### Positive Signals (Increase Score)
- Rancher reaches out proactively (+1 on Responsiveness)
- Herd size increases (annual review, +1 on Throughput)
- Current buyer relationship ends (Score 2 → 5 on Sales Channel)
- New HerdShare hub opens closer to rancher (+1 on Proximity)

### Negative Signals (Decrease Score)
- No response after 3+ follow-ups (-1 on Responsiveness)
- Signs exclusive contract with competitor (-4 on Sales Channel)
- Operation downsizes significantly (-1 on Throughput)

**Review and re-score quarterly** to keep pipeline accurate.

Location: ___________________________
Source: ___________________________ (e.g., Cattlemen Assoc., Auction List, Referral)

SCORING:
[1] Throughput (1-5): ____ | Est. Annual Head Count: ____
[2] Proximity (1-5): ____ | Distance to Hub: ____ miles
[3] Sales Channel (1-5): ____ | Current Channel: ____

## Integration with CRM

Scores should be tracked in your [CRM Structure](CRM_STRUCTURE.md):

**Required columns:**
- Lead Score (1-5)
- Priority Tier (1-5)
- Last Scored Date
- Next Review Date

**Automation opportunities:**
- Auto-sort leads by score (highest first)
- Flag leads for re-scoring after 90 days
- Alert when Tier 1 lead goes uncontacted >48 hours

---

## Common Scoring Mistakes

### ❌ Don't:
- Score based on gut feeling without data
- Ignore proximity in favor of volume (logistics matter)
- Assume all auction sellers are the same (assess responsiveness)
- Set scores and never revisit them (rancher situations change)

### ✅ Do:
- Use consistent criteria across all leads
- Gather data before scoring (don't guess head count)
- Re-score when new information emerges
- Focus 80% of time on Tier 1-2 leads

---

## Success Metrics

Track scoring effectiveness:
- **Conversion rate by tier:** What % of Tier 1 leads onboard? (Target: 30-40%)
- **Time to close by tier:** How long from first contact to onboarding? (Tier 1 should be fastest)
- **Score accuracy:** Do high-scored leads actually convert better? (Adjust criteria if not)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Score your first 50 leads** using this framework
2. **Sort by priority** and begin Tier 1 outreach
3. **Track conversion rates** to validate scoring accuracy
4. **Adjust criteria** quarterly based on performance data
