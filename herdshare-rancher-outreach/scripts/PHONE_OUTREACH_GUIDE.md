# HerdShare — Phone Outreach Guide

## Purpose

This guide provides frameworks, scripts, and best practices for phone conversations with rancher prospects.

**Goal:** Build trust, understand needs, and qualify fit—not close a sale on the first call.

---

## Guiding Principles

### The HerdShare Phone Approach

1. **Respectful:** Ranchers are busy. Get to the point and honor their time.
2. **Plainspoken:** No jargon, no buzzwords. Talk like a buyer, not a salesperson.
3. **Curious:** Ask questions. Listen more than you talk.
4. **Patient:** Relationships take time. One call rarely closes the deal.

### What This Is NOT
- ❌ A cold sales pitch
- ❌ A script to read verbatim
- ❌ A race to get them to say "yes"

### What This IS
- ✅ An introduction to a potential buyer relationship
- ✅ A conversation about their operation and needs
- ✅ A mutual evaluation of fit

---

## Pre-Call Preparation (5 Minutes Per Lead)

### Before You Dial:

1. **Review Lead Data**
   - Name, ranch name, location
   - Estimated herd size / throughput
   - Source (auction list, referral, association, etc.)
   - Lead score and priority tier

2. **Research Their Operation** (if info available)
   - Check their website or social media (if present)
   - Review recent auction sale results
   - Note any mutual connections (referrals)

3. **Confirm Logistics**
   - Distance from nearest HerdShare hub
   - Proximity to processing partners
   - Regional market conditions (drought, feed costs, etc.)

4. **Set Your Objective**
   - First call goal: Introduction + qualify interest
   - NOT: Close a deal or promise pricing

---

## Part 1: Introduction (30 seconds)

### Goal
Identify yourself, state your purpose, and ask for permission to continue.

### Script Framework

**Standard Cold Call:**
> "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with HerdShare. I got your name from [source—e.g., the Nebraska Cattlemen's Association / Joplin Stockyards consignor list]. We're a buyer working with independent cattle ranchers in [region]. Do you have a few minutes to talk, or is this a bad time?"

**Referral-Based Call:**
> "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with HerdShare. [Referring Rancher Name] suggested I reach out to you. We're working with ranchers in [region] as a direct buyer. Do you have a few minutes, or should I call back at a better time?"

### What to Listen For:
- **"Sure, what's this about?"** → Proceed to Part 2
- **"I'm busy right now."** → "No problem. When's a better time to call back?" (Schedule specific time)
- **"Not interested."** → "I understand. Can I ask—are you currently selling through auction, or do you have a buyer relationship in place?" (Brief qualifying question, then respect their answer)

### Notes:
- If they're in the field, on a tractor, or clearly distracted → offer to call back
- Respect "no" immediately. Don't push.

---

## Part 2: Context & Credibility (30 seconds)

### Goal
Establish what HerdShare is and why you're calling (without sounding like a sales pitch).

### Script Framework

> "HerdShare is a supply platform that connects independent ranchers with institutional buyers—schools, hospitals, food programs. We're not a retail brand or marketplace. We're infrastructure. We buy directly from ranchers, handle processing and distribution, and offer predictable volumes and transparent pricing. We're looking to work with ranchers in [region] because we're building out supply near [hub location]."

### Alternative (Simpler Version):
> "We're a buyer looking for long-term supply relationships with independent ranchers. We work with institutions that need reliable beef, and we're trying to build a network of rancher partners in [region]. That's why I'm reaching out."

### What to Listen For:
- **"Okay, go on."** → Proceed to Part 3
- **"So you're like [X competitor]?"** → "Not exactly. We're not [describe how you're different]. Can I ask how you currently sell your cattle?"
- **Skepticism or silence** → Acknowledge it: "I know this is out of the blue. Can I ask a few questions about how you currently operate?"

---

## Part 3: Discovery Questions (3-5 minutes)

### Goal
Understand their operation, current sales process, pain points, and openness to alternatives.

### Core Questions to Ask

#### Question 1: Current Sales Process
> **"How do you currently sell your cattle?"**

**What to listen for:**
- "Mostly through auction" → Good fit (flexibility)
- "Local buyer, same guy for 10 years" → Possible fit (ask follow-up: "Are you open to diversifying?")
- "Under contract with [processor]" → Likely not a fit (respect existing relationship)

---

#### Question 2: Volume & Timing
> **"How many head do you typically sell in a year, and when?"**

**What to listen for:**
- 50+ head annually → Viable scale
- Seasonal (spring calves, fall yearlings) → Note timing for supply planning
- "Depends on the year" → Ask about average or range

---

#### Question 3: Pain Points
> **"What's been your biggest challenge selling cattle over the past couple years?"**

**What to listen for:**
- "Prices are all over the place" → Pricing volatility pain (strong fit)
- "Hard to find reliable buyers" → Buyer reliability pain (strong fit)
- "Freight costs" → Logistics pain (neutral, but addressable)
- "I'm happy with my current setup" → Likely not a fit (don't push)

---

#### Question 4: Openness to Contracts
> **"Have you ever worked with a buyer on a contract basis, or do you prefer spot sales?"**

**What to listen for:**
- "I've done contracts before, it worked well" → Ideal
- "Never tried it, but I'm open" → Good
- "I like the flexibility of auctions" → Neutral (explain predictability benefits)
- "I don't want to be locked in" → Address misconception (contracts protect both sides)

---

#### Question 5: Location & Logistics
> **"Where's your operation located, and do you work with any specific processors?"**

**What to listen for:**
- Within 150 miles of hub → Good fit
- Already working with a processor HerdShare partners with → Excellent fit
- 200+ miles away → Marginal fit (only pursue if high volume)

---

### Follow-Up & Probing

**If they express frustration:**
> "Yeah, I hear that a lot from ranchers in [region]. That's part of why we're building this—trying to create more predictable demand. Can I share how we approach pricing and volumes?"

**If they're vague or guarded:**
> "I'm not trying to pry—just trying to understand if we'd be a good fit. We're not right for every operation, and that's okay."

**If they mention a competitor:**
> "Got it. How's that relationship working for you? Are you looking to diversify at all, or are you set?"

---

## Part 4: Value Proposition (1-2 minutes)

### Goal
Explain HerdShare's value in terms of THEIR needs (not generic features).

### Script Framework (Customize Based on Pain Points)

**If they mentioned pricing volatility:**
> "Here's how we work: We offer contracted volumes with transparent pricing tied to a baseline, so you know what to expect. You're not stuck guessing what auction prices will be on sale day. We're not always the highest price, but we're predictable. And we pay on [payment terms, e.g., Net 30]. Does that sound like something worth exploring?"

**If they mentioned buyer reliability:**
> "We're building long-term relationships. Once we start working with a rancher, we're planning quarters and years out, not just one-off loads. We want consistent supply, so we offer consistent demand. If that's something you value, we should keep talking."

**If they're satisfied with current setup:**
> "That's great—sounds like you've got a good thing going. I don't want to disrupt that. But if your situation changes or you're looking to diversify buyers down the road, we're here. Can I follow up in six months?"

### What NOT to Say:
- ❌ "We're disrupting the cattle industry"
- ❌ "Our platform uses cutting-edge technology"
- ❌ "You'll make way more money with us"
- ❌ "Auctions are broken" (don't trash their current process)

### What TO Say:
- ✅ "We're a reliable buyer"
- ✅ "Predictable demand and pricing"
- ✅ "Long-term relationships"
- ✅ "Respect for your operation"

---

## Part 5: Next Steps (30 seconds)

### Goal
Define a clear next action—don't leave it vague.

### Possible Outcomes & Scripts

#### Outcome A: Strong Interest
> "Great. Let me send you an email with more details about how we work, and we can schedule a time to talk specifics—pricing, volumes, timing. Does [specific day/time] work for a follow-up call?"

**Action:** Send follow-up email within 24 hours. Log interest level as "High" in CRM.

---

#### Outcome B: Moderate Interest ("Tell me more")
> "Sure. I'll send you an email with an overview of our model and some info on the ranchers we're already working with. Take a look, and let me know if you want to talk further. Fair?"

**Action:** Send email. Log interest level as "Medium." Follow up in 1 week.

---

#### Outcome C: Low Interest ("Not right now")
> "No problem. Can I check back in a few months? Things change, and I don't want to lose touch."

**Action:** Log interest level as "Low." Schedule follow-up in 3-6 months.

---

#### Outcome D: Referral Opportunity (Even if They're Not Interested)
> "I understand. Quick question—do you know any other ranchers in the area who might be interested in a buyer relationship? We're trying to build out our network in [county/region]."

**Action:** Log referral names and contact info. Thank them.

---

## Handling Common Objections

### Objection 1: "I'm happy with auctions."

**Response:**
> "That makes sense. Auctions work well for a lot of ranchers. We're not trying to replace that—just offer another option. If you ever want to diversify or lock in some volume outside of auction, let me know."

**Don't argue.** Respect their preference.

---

### Objection 2: "I don't know who you are / never heard of HerdShare."

**Response:**
> "Totally fair. We're relatively new in [region]. We work with [mention any local partners, e.g., 'X Processing'] and a handful of ranchers already. I'm happy to connect you with [Rancher Name] if you want a reference. Or I can send you info and you can check us out."

**Offer proof:** References, website, emails.

---

### Objection 3: "I'm under contract already."

**Response:**
> "Got it. I respect that. If your situation changes or you're looking to diversify down the road, feel free to reach out. Appreciate your time."

**Do NOT try to poach.** It's unethical and will hurt your reputation.

---

### Objection 4: "What are your prices?"

**Response:**
> "Great question. Our pricing is tied to [explain baseline, e.g., 'market index + premium' or 'negotiated rate based on volume']. It depends on factors like volume, timing, and logistics. If you're interested, I'd want to understand your operation better before quoting anything specific. Can we schedule a time to walk through that?"

**Don't quote prices blindly.** You need more info to be accurate.

---

### Objection 5: "I need to think about it."

**Response:**
> "Absolutely. Take your time. I'll send you an email with more info. Can I follow up next week, or would you prefer to reach out when you're ready?"

**Don't pressure.** Give them space, but set a follow-up.

## Weekly Call Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Calls made | 30-50 | Mix of Tier 1-3 leads |
| Conversations held (>2 min) | 15-25 | Not all calls will connect |
| Strong interest | 5-10 | Leads who want follow-up |
| Meetings scheduled | 2-5 | In-person or deeper calls |
| Referrals received | 1-3 | Even from "no" responses |

**Quality > Quantity.** 10 good conversations beat 50 voicemails.

## Tips for Better Phone Conversations

### ✅ Do:
- **Smile when you talk** (they can hear it)
- **Take notes during the call** (shows you care)
- **Use their name** (builds rapport)
- **Ask follow-up questions** (shows genuine interest)
- **End calls on time** (respect their schedule)

### ❌ Don't:
- **Read from a script** (sounds robotic)
- **Talk over them** (let them finish)
- **Use jargon** ("synergies," "disruption," "leverage")
- **Overpromise** (be honest about what you can deliver)
- **Push when they say no** (damages long-term relationship)

## Sample Call Flow (Full Example)

**Scenario:** Calling a Tier 2 lead (Score: 3.8) from an auction consignor list.

---

**You:** Hi, is this Tom?

**Tom:** Yeah, who's calling?

**You:** Hey Tom, this is Sarah with HerdShare. I got your name from the Billings Livestock consignor list. We're a buyer working with independent cattle ranchers in Montana. Do you have a few minutes to talk, or is this a bad time?

**Tom:** I got a few minutes. What's this about?

**You:** We're a supply platform that connects independent ranchers with institutional buyers—schools, hospitals, food programs. We buy directly from ranchers and offer predictable volumes and transparent pricing. We're building out our network in your area, which is why I'm reaching out. Can I ask—how do you currently sell your cattle?

**Tom:** Mostly through Billings Livestock. Sometimes a local buyer if the price is right.

**You:** Got it. How many head do you typically sell in a year?

**Tom:** About 120, give or take.

**You:** And what's been your biggest challenge with selling over the past couple years?

**Tom:** Prices are all over the damn place. One week you're at $1.40, next week it's $1.20. Hard to plan.

**You:** Yeah, I hear that a lot. That's part of why we're building this—trying to create more predictable demand. We offer contracted volumes with transparent pricing, so you know what to expect before sale day. We're not always the highest price, but we're predictable. And we pay Net 30. Does that sound like something worth exploring?

**Tom:** Maybe. I'd have to know more about your pricing.

**You:** Totally fair. Our pricing depends on volume, timing, and logistics. I'd want to understand your operation better before quoting anything specific. How about this—I'll send you an email with an overview of how we work, and we can schedule a follow-up call next week to go deeper. Does Thursday afternoon work?

**Tom:** Thursday's fine. Send me that email.

**You:** Will do. Thanks for your time, Tom. Talk to you Thursday.

---

**Post-call:**
- Log call in CRM: "Interested, frustrated with price volatility, 120 head/year, follow-up scheduled for Thursday"
- Send email within 2 hours
- Mark lead as "High Interest" and update score to 4.2

---

## Next Steps

1. **Practice the framework** with 5-10 practice calls (internal team)
2. **Start with Tier 2-3 leads** to build confidence (save Tier 1 for when you're sharp)
3. **Track your call metrics** using [CRM Structure](../tracking/CRM_STRUCTURE.md)
4. **Refine based on feedback** (what objections are you hearing most?)
5. **Scale up** as you get comfortable
