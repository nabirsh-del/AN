# HerdShare — Email Outreach Templates

## Purpose

This document provides email templates for rancher outreach across different scenarios and stages of the relationship.

**Tone:** Professional, respectful, plainspoken. No marketing fluff.

---

## Email Fundamentals

### Core Principles

1. **Subject lines:** Clear and direct (no clickbait)
2. **Length:** Short (200-300 words max)
3. **Personalization:** Always include rancher's name and specific details
4. **Call to action:** One clear next step
5. **Signature:** Real person, real contact info

### What NOT to Do
- ❌ Use marketing automation language ("Dear [FIRST_NAME]")
- ❌ Write long essays
- ❌ Use all caps or excessive punctuation!!!
- ❌ Attach large PDFs without asking
- ❌ CC multiple people on first email (feels impersonal)

---

## Template 1: Initial Cold Outreach (No Prior Contact)

### When to Use
First email to a rancher you've never spoken to (sourced from directories, auction lists, etc.).

### Subject Line
**"Buyer looking for rancher partners in [County/Region]"**

### Email Body

```
Hi [Rancher First Name],

My name is [Your Name], and I work with HerdShare, a supply platform connecting independent cattle ranchers with institutional buyers (schools, hospitals, food programs).

I came across your name through [specific source—e.g., "the Montana Stockgrowers Association" / "Billings Livestock consignor list"], and I wanted to reach out because we're building our rancher network in [region/county].

We're not a retail brand or marketplace—we're infrastructure. We buy directly from ranchers, handle processing and distribution, and offer predictable volumes with transparent pricing. We work with ranchers who are looking for an alternative to spot auction sales or who want to diversify their buyer relationships.

If this sounds like something worth exploring, I'd be happy to set up a quick call to learn more about your operation and see if there's a fit.

You can reply to this email or call me directly at [phone number].

Thanks for your time.

[Your Name]
HerdShare
[Email] | [Phone]
```

### Notes
- Keep it under 150 words
- Mention specific source (builds credibility)
- One clear CTA: reply or call

---

## Template 2: Post-Phone Call Follow-Up (Strong Interest)

### When to Use
After a positive phone conversation where the rancher expressed interest.

### Subject Line
**"Following up—HerdShare partnership details"**

### Email Body

```
Hi [Rancher First Name],

Thanks for taking the time to talk earlier today. I enjoyed learning about your operation and hearing about [specific detail from conversation—e.g., "your approach to fall calf sales" / "the challenges you've had with auction price volatility"].

As discussed, here's a quick overview of how we work:

• Direct buyer relationship: We purchase cattle directly from ranchers (no middlemen)
• Predictable demand: Contracted volumes so you can plan ahead
• Transparent pricing: Tied to [brief pricing explanation, e.g., "market baselines + quality premiums"]
• Payment terms: Net [X] days
• Processing: We work with [processor name/region] for logistics

Next steps:
I'd like to schedule a follow-up call for [specific day/time] to discuss pricing, volumes, and timing for your operation. Does that work?

Looking forward to continuing the conversation.

[Your Name]
HerdShare
[Email] | [Phone]
```

### Notes
- Reference something specific from your call (shows you listened)
- Include concrete details (pricing structure, payment terms)
- Propose specific next step with date/time

---

## Template 3: Post-Phone Call Follow-Up (Moderate Interest)

### When to Use
After a conversation where the rancher was interested but cautious or needed more information.

### Subject Line
**"Info on HerdShare—let me know what you think"**

### Email Body

```
Hi [Rancher First Name],

Thanks for chatting earlier. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short.

Based on our conversation, it sounds like you're [restate their situation—e.g., "primarily selling through auction but open to diversifying" / "looking for more predictable pricing"]. That's exactly the kind of rancher we're looking to work with.

Here's what we offer:
• Reliable buyer relationship (not one-off purchases)
• Contracted volumes so you can plan your operation
• Transparent pricing (no surprises on sale day)
• Long-term partnerships (we're building supply infrastructure, not flipping cattle)

We're working with [X] ranchers in [region] already, and I'd be happy to connect you with [Rancher Name] as a reference if that'd be helpful.

Take a look and let me know if you want to dig deeper. No pressure—just wanted to make sure you have the info.

[Your Name]

[Email] | [Phone]
```

### Notes
- Acknowledge their caution (builds trust)
- Offer references (social proof)
- "No pressure" tone (respects their autonomy)

## Template 4: Referral Introduction (Warm Lead)

### When to Use
When a current rancher partner refers you to another rancher.

### Subject Line
**"[Referring Rancher Name] suggested I reach out"**

### Email Body

```
Hi [Rancher First Name],

My name is [Your Name] with HerdShare. [Referring Rancher Name] suggested I reach out to you—said you might be interested in a buyer relationship for your cattle operation.

We work with independent ranchers in [region] as a direct buyer (we supply schools, hospitals, and food programs). [Referring Rancher] has been working with us since [timeframe], and we've been able to offer him [specific benefit—e.g., "predictable volumes and pricing" / "reliable off-take for his fall calves"].

I don't want to assume this is a fit for your operation, but if you're open to a conversation, I'd be happy to set up a quick call to learn more about how you currently sell and see if we can help.

You can reach me at [phone] or just reply here.

Thanks—

[Your Name]
HerdShare
[Email] | [Phone]
```

### Notes
- Lead with the referral name (instant credibility)
- Mention specific benefit referring rancher received
- Casual, non-pushy tone

## Template 5: Re-Engagement (Following Up After No Response)

### When to Use
Rancher showed initial interest but went quiet. 1-2 weeks after last contact.

### Subject Line
**"Checking in—still interested?"**

### Email Body

```
Hi [Rancher First Name],

I wanted to follow up on my email from [date] about working together as a buyer for your cattle.

I know things get busy, especially this time of year. If now's not a good time, no worries—I can check back in a few months.

But if you're still interested in learning more about how we work (predictable demand, transparent pricing, long-term relationships), I'm happy to set up a quick call.

Let me know.

[Your Name]
HerdShare
[Email] | [Phone]
```

### Notes
- Acknowledge they're busy (respectful)
- Give them an easy "out" (reduces pressure)
- Keep it brief (3-4 sentences max)

---

## Template 6: Long-Term Nurture (Low-Interest Lead)

### When to Use
Rancher said "not right now" but didn't close the door. Follow up every 3-6 months.

### Subject Line
**"Checking in—HerdShare update"**

### Email Body

```
Hi [Rancher First Name],

It's been a few months since we last spoke, and I wanted to check in to see if your situation has changed.

We've expanded our rancher network in [region] and are now working with [number] operations in [county/area]. We're still looking for [specific profile—e.g., "ranchers selling 50+ head annually through auction"] who want a reliable buyer alternative.

If you're open to exploring this, let me know and we can set up a call. If not, I'll check back in another few months.

Thanks—

[Your Name]
HerdShare
[Email] | [Phone]

### Email Body

```
Hi [Rancher First Name],

I've enjoyed our conversations over the past few weeks, and I think there's a real opportunity to work together.

I'll be in [town/region] next [day of week], and I'd love to stop by your operation to meet in person and talk specifics—pricing, volumes, timing, logistics.

Would [specific date/time, e.g., "Wednesday, January 22 around 2pm"] work? I'm flexible if another time is better.

Looking forward to it.

[Your Name]
HerdShare
[Email] | [Phone]
```

### Notes
- Propose specific date/time (makes it easy to say yes)
- Frame as "I'm already in the area" (not "I'm making a special trip just for you"—reduces pressure)
- Keep it short

## Template 8: Asking for Referrals (From Current Partner)

### When to Use
After a successful first delivery or when relationship is strong.

### Subject Line
**"Quick question—ranchers you'd recommend?"**

### Email Body

```
Hi [Rancher First Name],

Hope things are going well on your end. I wanted to reach out with a quick question.

We're looking to work with more ranchers in [county/region], and I figured you might know some folks who'd be a good fit—operations similar to yours that could benefit from a reliable buyer relationship.

If anyone comes to mind, I'd really appreciate an introduction. Happy to make the first contact so you don't have to do any heavy lifting.

Let me know. Thanks—

[Your Name]
HerdShare
[Email] | [Phone]
```

### Notes
- Ask AFTER first successful interaction (not before)
- Make it easy ("I'll make first contact")

### Subject Line
**"Thanks for your time"**

### Email Body

```
Hi [Rancher First Name],

Thanks for letting me know. I appreciate you taking the time to consider it.

If your situation changes down the road, feel free to reach out—we'll be around.

Best of luck with your operation.

## Email Best Practices

### Timing
- **Best days:** Tuesday-Thursday (avoid Mondays and Fridays)
- **Best times:** 6-8am or 6-8pm (when ranchers check email before/after field work)
- **Follow-up cadence:** 3-5 days after first email, then 1-2 weeks, then monthly

### Subject Line Tips
✅ **Good:**
- "Buyer looking for rancher partners in Dawson County"
- "Following up—HerdShare partnership"
- "Tom Miller suggested I reach out"

❌ **Bad:**
- "You won't believe this opportunity!!!"
- "Urgent: Read this now"
- "Transform your cattle operation"

### Personalization Checklist
Before hitting send, confirm:
- ✅ Used rancher's actual first name (not "Dear Sir/Madam")
- ✅ Mentioned specific source or referral
- ✅ Referenced something from prior conversation (if applicable)
- ✅ Specified their region/county
- ✅ Included your direct phone number

---

## Email Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Open rate | 40-60% | Subject line quality matters |
| Response rate | 10-20% | Quality leads + good copy |
| Meeting booked rate | 5-10% | From initial email to scheduled call |

**Track in CRM:** Every email sent, opened (if tracking), and responded to.

---

## Common Email Mistakes

### ❌ Don't:
- Send generic "batch and blast" emails
- Use overly formal language ("Dear Esteemed Rancher")
- Write paragraphs longer than 3-4 sentences
- Include multiple CTAs (confusing)
- Send attachments on first email (feels spammy)

### ✅ Do:
- Write like you're emailing a colleague (professional but casual)
- Keep it scannable (short sentences, bullet points)
- Include one clear next step
- Proofread (typos kill credibility)
- Follow up consistently

---

## Next Steps

1. **Customize templates** with your name, region, and specific details
2. **Test subject lines** and track open rates
3. **A/B test** different approaches (e.g., shorter vs. longer emails)
4. **Log all emails** in [CRM Structure](../tracking/CRM_STRUCTURE.md)
5. **Refine based on response rates**
