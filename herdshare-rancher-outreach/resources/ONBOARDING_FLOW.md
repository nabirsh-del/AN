## Stage 1: Interest Qualification (Days 1-3)

### Objective
Confirm the rancher is genuinely interested and meets basic fit criteria.

### Actions

#### 1.1 Initial Interest Call
- **Duration:** 10-15 minutes
- **Format:** Phone call (preferred) or video call
- **Script:** Use [Phone Outreach Guide](../scripts/PHONE_OUTREACH_GUIDE.md)

**Key Topics:**
- How they currently sell cattle
- Annual volume (head count)
- Location and proximity to HerdShare hub
- Interest level in contracted supply

**Qualifying Questions:**
- Are they independent or corporate-owned?
- Do they have decision-making authority?
- What's their biggest sales challenge?
- Are they open to contracts (vs. 100% spot sales)?

---

#### 1.2 Post-Call Assessment
- Score lead using [Lead Scoring Framework](../tracking/LEAD_SCORING.md)
- Update CRM with detailed notes
- Determine if rancher is qualified to proceed

**Qualified rancher criteria:**
✅ Independent operation
✅ 50+ head annual volume
✅ Within 150 miles of hub
✅ Expressed clear interest
✅ Decision-maker authority

**If NOT qualified:** Thank them, explain it's not a fit at this time, archive in CRM.

**If qualified:** Proceed to Stage 2.

---

#### 1.3 Send Follow-Up Email
- **Timing:** Within 24 hours of call
- **Template:** Use [Email Template #2](../scripts/EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md) (Post-Phone Call Follow-Up)

**Include:**
- Brief recap of call
- Overview of HerdShare model
- Next steps: Schedule deeper conversation

---

## Stage 2: Discovery & Fit Assessment (Days 4-10)

### Objective
Understand the rancher's operation in detail and assess supply fit.

### Actions

#### 2.1 Supply Fit Assessment Call
- **Duration:** 30-45 minutes
- **Format:** Phone or in-person (in-person preferred if within 100 miles)
- **Participants:** Rancher + HerdShare rep (potentially bring processing partner rep if available)

**Topics to Cover:**

**Operation Details:**
- Herd size and breed composition
- Calving/finishing cycle (timing)
- Annual throughput and variability
- Current nutrition and finishing practices
- Ranch location and loading facilities

**Sales History:**
- How they currently sell (auction, local buyer, processor)
- Average price received (last 12 months)
- Payment terms they're used to
- Positive and negative experiences with current channels

**Logistics:**
- Distance to nearest HerdShare hub
- Distance to processing partner
- On-ranch loading capability (chute, scale, pens)
- Availability for hauling and delivery scheduling

**Goals & Concerns:**
- What they're looking for in a buyer relationship
- Concerns about contracted supply
- Deal-breakers (if any)

---

#### 2.2 Internal Fit Assessment
After the call, evaluate:
- **Volume fit:** Does their throughput match HerdShare demand in that region?
- **Timing fit:** Does their delivery schedule align with processing capacity?
- **Logistics fit:** Are freight costs reasonable given distance?
- **Quality fit:** Do their cattle meet HerdShare specs (weight, grade, etc.)?

**Decision:**
- **Strong fit:** Proceed to Stage 3
- **Marginal fit:** Discuss with leadership before proceeding
- **Not a fit:** Politely explain why and offer to revisit in 6-12 months

---

#### 2.3 Send Supply Assessment Summary
- **Timing:** Within 48 hours
- **Format:** Email

**Include:**
- Summary of what you learned
- Preliminary assessment of fit
- Next steps: Pricing and volume discussion

**Example:**

> Hi [Name],
>
> Thanks for the detailed conversation yesterday. Based on what you shared, I think there's a strong fit between your operation and HerdShare's supply needs.
>
> **What I heard:**
> - You sell ~150 head annually, primarily through auction
> - You finish calves in the fall (Sept-Nov)
> - You're located 85 miles from our Billings hub
> - You're interested in more predictable pricing and guaranteed off-take
>
> **Next step:** Let's schedule a follow-up call to discuss pricing structure, volumes, and contract terms. Does [date/time] work?
>
> Looking forward to it—
>
> [Your Name]

---

## Stage 3: Pricing & Volume Discussion (Days 11-20)

### Objective
Align on pricing structure, volumes, and commercial terms.

### Actions

#### 3.1 Pricing Discussion Call
- **Duration:** 45-60 minutes
- **Format:** Phone or in-person
- **Participants:** Rancher + HerdShare commercial lead

**Topics to Cover:**

**Pricing Structure:**
- Baseline price methodology (e.g., market index + premium)
- How pricing is set and updated
- Quality premiums (if applicable)
- Weight bands and price adjustments

**Volume Commitment:**
- Quarterly or annual volume (head count or lbs)
- Flexibility (+/- X% allowable variance)
- Scheduling (delivery windows)

**Payment Terms:**
- Standard: Net 30 days from delivery
- Payment method (check, ACH, wire)

**Contract Duration:**
- Recommended: 12-month initial term with auto-renewal
- Option to start with 3-6 month pilot

**Other Terms:**
- Transportation responsibility (HerdShare arranges hauling)
- Quality standards and rejections
- Force majeure (drought, disease, etc.)

---

#### 3.2 Address Questions & Concerns
Common rancher concerns:

**"What if market prices spike and I'm locked in?"**
> "Our pricing adjusts with market baselines, so you're not locked into a fixed price. If markets spike, you benefit. The difference is predictability—you know the structure, not a surprise auction day price."

**"What if I can't deliver the full volume?"**
> "We build in +/-10% flexibility. If there's a major shortfall due to drought or other factors, we work with you. We're not looking to penalize—life happens on a ranch."

**"How do I know you'll pay on time?"**
> "We pay Net 30 on every delivery, no exceptions. I can connect you with [Existing Rancher Name] who can vouch for our payment reliability. And as you refer more ranchers, you can earn faster payment terms (Net 25, Net 20)."

**"What if I don't like the contract?"**
> "We offer a 3-6 month pilot to start. If it's not working for you, we part ways respectfully. No long-term lock-in until you're confident."

---

#### 4.2 Ranch Visit (If Feasible)

## Onboarding Success Metrics

### Track for Every Rancher:

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Time to Onboard** | 45-60 days | From first contact to first delivery |
| **Onboarding Completion Rate** | 70-80% | Of interested ranchers who start onboarding, % who complete |
| **First Delivery Success** | 100% | No rejections, no payment issues |
| **Rancher Satisfaction (Post-Delivery)** | 8+/10 | Ask: "On a scale of 1-10, how was the experience?" |
| **Referral Rate (Post-First Delivery)** | 40-60% | % of onboarded ranchers who provide ≥1 referral |

---

## Common Onboarding Mistakes

### ❌ Don't:
- Rush the process (trust takes time)
- Skip the ranch visit (in-person matters)
- Over-promise on pricing (be transparent about how it works)
- Forget to follow up after first delivery (this is critical)
- Neglect post-delivery payment confirmation (ensure they got paid)

### ✅ Do:
- Communicate frequently (weekly check-ins during onboarding)
- Be transparent (if there are delays or issues, say so)
- Build personal relationship (learn about their operation and goals)
- Deliver on promises (if you say you'll call Tuesday, call Tuesday)
- Celebrate milestones (first delivery, first payment, first referral)
