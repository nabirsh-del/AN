# HerdShare — Rancher Referral Program Design

## Purpose

This document outlines the rancher-to-rancher referral program designed to turn satisfied HerdShare partners into your most effective lead generation channel.

**Goal:** Build a self-sustaining referral flywheel where onboarded ranchers consistently refer nearby peers, reducing acquisition costs and improving lead quality.

---

## Why Referrals Work for Ranchers

### The Trust Factor

Ranchers are naturally skeptical of outsiders and new business models. Referrals overcome this because:

- **Peer validation:** Ranchers trust other ranchers more than any marketing message
- **Shared experience:** "If it works for my neighbor, maybe it'll work for me"
- **Local credibility:** Referrals from nearby ranchers carry more weight than distant testimonials
- **Risk reduction:** Knowing someone who's already working with you reduces perceived risk

### Referral Program Success Metrics

Industry benchmarks for B2B referral programs:
- **Referral-to-lead conversion:** 25-40% (vs. 5-10% for cold outreach)
- **Referral-to-onboard conversion:** 15-25% (vs. 3-5% for cold leads)
- **Time to close:** 50% faster than cold leads
- **Retention:** 2x higher than non-referred partners

**Referrals are your highest-quality, lowest-cost lead source.**

## Referral Program Framework

### The Three-Tier Incentive Structure

```
Tier 1: Single Referral (1 qualified referral)
    ↓
Tier 2: Multiple Referrals (3+ qualified referrals)
    ↓
Tier 3: Founding Rancher (5+ onboarded referrals)
```

**Qualified referral:** Referred rancher completes first delivery with HerdShare.

---

## Tier 1: Single Referral Incentive

### For Every 1 Qualified Referral, Referring Rancher Receives:

**Option A: Priority Allocation**
- During high-demand periods, referring rancher gets first access to available slots
- Guaranteed minimum volume commitment (even when demand exceeds supply)
- Value to rancher: Planning certainty during peak seasons

**Option B: Accelerated Payment Terms**
- Standard payment: Net 30 days
- Referral incentive: Net 25 days (5-day acceleration)
- Value to rancher: Improved cash flow

**Option C: Volume Guarantee**
- Referring rancher receives guaranteed off-take for next quarter
- Protection against demand fluctuations
- Value to rancher: Stability and planning confidence

**Rancher chooses which incentive they prefer** (flexibility builds goodwill).

---

## Tier 2: Multiple Referrals (3+ Qualified)

### For 3+ Qualified Referrals, Referring Rancher Receives:

**All Tier 1 Benefits, Plus:**

## How the Referral Program Works

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Onboard Rancher & Build Trust
- Complete first delivery successfully
- Ensure positive experience (on-time payment, good communication, fair pricing)
- **Timing matters:** Only ask for referrals AFTER first delivery, not before

#### Step 2: Ask for Referrals (The Right Way)
- **When:** 2-4 weeks after first successful delivery
- **How:** In-person visit, phone call, or personalized email (not automated)
- **Script:** "We're looking to work with more ranchers like you in [county/region]. Do you know any nearby producers who might benefit from a reliable buyer relationship?"

#### Step 3: Make It Easy
- Provide simple referral form (name, phone, ranch location)
- Offer to make first contact (rancher doesn't have to pitch for you)
- No pressure—frame it as a favor, not an obligation

#### Step 4: Act Quickly on Referrals
- Contact referred rancher within 48 hours
- Lead with the referral: "[Referring Rancher] suggested I reach out"
- Treat referred leads as top priority (Tier 1 outreach)

#### Step 5: Close the Loop
- Update referring rancher on status: "Thanks for the intro—I connected with [name] and we're setting up a call"
- When referred rancher onboards, immediately notify referring rancher and activate their incentive
- Publicly thank them (if appropriate): "Appreciate you connecting us with [name]—looking forward to working with them"

#### Step 6: Track & Reward
- Log all referrals in CRM ([Referral Tracking Tab](../tracking/CRM_STRUCTURE.md))
- Activate incentives immediately upon referred rancher's first delivery
- Follow up quarterly: "You're at 2 referrals—one more and you unlock enhanced payment terms"

## Referral Request Scripts

### In-Person / Phone Script

**Scenario:** After successful first delivery, during follow-up conversation.

> "Hey [Name], I wanted to say thanks again for working with us. It's been great getting to know your operation.
>
> Quick question—we're looking to work with more ranchers in [county/region], and I figured you might know some folks who'd be a good fit. Anyone come to mind who sells through auction or is looking for a reliable buyer relationship?
>
> If so, I'm happy to reach out directly—you don't have to do any heavy lifting. Just pass along their name and number, and I'll take it from there.
>
> And as a thank you, for every rancher you refer who works with us, you'll get [priority allocation / faster payment / volume guarantee]—whichever matters most to you."

**Key points:**
- Thank them first (builds goodwill)
- Make it easy (you'll do the outreach)
- Explain the incentive (clear value proposition)

---

### Email Script

**Subject:** Quick question—ranchers you'd recommend?

> Hi [Name],
>
> Hope things are going well on your end. I wanted to reach out with a quick question.
>
> We're looking to work with more ranchers in [county/region], and I figured you might know some folks who'd be a good fit—operations similar to yours that could benefit from a reliable buyer relationship.
>
> If anyone comes to mind, I'd really appreciate an introduction. I'm happy to make the first contact, so you don't have to pitch on our behalf.
>
> As a thank you, for every rancher you refer who becomes a partner, you'll earn [specific incentive—priority allocation, accelerated payment, etc.]. And if you refer 3+, you'll unlock even more benefits (enhanced payment terms, annual planning sessions, and preferred partner status).
>
> Let me know if anyone comes to mind. Thanks—
>
> [Your Name]
> HerdShare

## Referral Activation & Communication

### When a Referral Onboards

**Immediately notify the referring rancher:**

**Email Template:**

**Subject:** Great news—[Referred Rancher] is onboarded!

> Hi [Referring Rancher Name],
>
> I wanted to let you know that [Referred Rancher Name] just completed their first delivery with us. Thanks for making that introduction—it's been great working with them.
>
> As a thank you, I've activated your [specific incentive—e.g., "priority allocation benefit"]. This means [explain what it means—e.g., "you'll have first access to slots during high-demand periods, starting next quarter"].
>
> You're now at [X] qualified referrals. [If applicable: "Just [Y] more and you'll unlock Tier 2 benefits: enhanced payment terms and annual supply planning sessions."]
>
> Appreciate you being a great partner and helping us build our rancher network. Let me know if you have any other folks in mind.
>
> Thanks—
>
> [Your Name]
> HerdShare

## Referral Program Tracking

### Data to Capture (in CRM)

For every referral:
- **Referring rancher name & ID**
- **Referred rancher name & contact info**
- **Referral date**
- **Referral source** (in-person ask, email ask, unsolicited)
- **Lead status** (contacted, interested, onboarded, not interested)
- **Onboarding date** (if successful)
- **Incentive tier earned**
- **Incentive activated date**

See [Referral Tracking Tab](../tracking/CRM_STRUCTURE.md) for full CRM structure.

### Referral Program Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **% of onboarded ranchers who refer** | 40-60% | Not all will refer—that's okay |
| **Avg referrals per referring rancher** | 1.5-2.5 | Over lifetime of relationship |
| **Referral-to-lead conversion** | 30-50% | Higher than cold outreach |
| **Referral-to-onboard conversion** | 15-25% | Track separately from cold leads |
| **Time to onboard (referral vs. cold)** | 50% faster | Referrals close quicker |
| **Cost per referral-sourced onboard** | $100-200 | Lower than cold outreach ($400-600) |

---

## Referral Program Economics

### Cost Analysis

**Incentive Costs (Annual, Per Referring Rancher):**

| Incentive | Estimated Cost | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Priority allocation | $0 | Operational benefit, no direct cost |
| Accelerated payment (Net 25 vs. Net 30) | ~$50 | 5-day cash flow impact (minimal) |
| Volume guarantee | $0 | Commitment, not cash outlay |
| Enhanced payment (Net 20) | ~$100 | 10-day cash flow impact |
| Annual planning session | $200 | Staff time, travel (if in-person) |
| Pricing premium (+$0.05/lb) | ~$500 | On 200-head annual volume |

**Total annual cost for Tier 3 Founding Rancher:** ~$850

**Value of 5 onboarded referrals:** ~$2,500-3,000 (vs. $2,000-3,000 cost via cold outreach)

**ROI:** Positive, even with premium incentives.

---

### Why This Structure Works

- **Low cash outlay:** Most incentives are operational (priority, guarantees), not cash bonuses
- **Aligned incentives:** Ranchers want reliability and planning certainty more than cash bonuses
- **Scalable:** Costs only incurred when referrals successfully onboard
- **Retention benefit:** Referring ranchers become more deeply committed (higher retention)

---

## Referral Program Launch Plan

### Phase 1: Soft Launch (First 10 Onboarded Ranchers)
- **Timing:** Start asking for referrals after 5th successful partnership
- **Approach:** Informal asks during follow-up calls
- **Goal:** Test messaging, validate incentive appeal
- **Metrics:** Track referral rate, conversion rate

### Phase 2: Formal Program Launch (After 20 Onboarded Ranchers)
- **Timing:** Once you have critical mass
- **Approach:** Formalize program, create one-page explainer
- **Communication:** Email all current partners explaining referral benefits
- **Goal:** Generate 10-15 referrals in first quarter

### Phase 3: Optimization (Ongoing)
- **Timing:** After first 10 referrals onboarded
- **Approach:** A/B test different incentives, messaging
- **Goal:** Increase % of ranchers who refer from 40% to 60%

## Common Referral Program Mistakes

### ❌ Don't:
- Ask for referrals before building trust (wait until after first delivery)
- Make the process complicated (keep it simple: name + phone)
- Offer cash bonuses (misaligns incentives, feels transactional)
- Forget to close the loop (always update referring rancher on status)
- Automate referral requests (personal ask = higher conversion)

### ✅ Do:
- Ask every onboarded rancher (you'll never get referrals you don't ask for)
- Make it easy (you do the outreach, not them)
- Offer valuable, non-cash incentives (priority, guarantees, premiums)
- Track diligently (CRM is critical)
- Recognize and thank referring ranchers publicly (builds status)

## Referral Program FAQs

### Q: When should I start asking for referrals?
**A:** After the rancher's first successful delivery. Don't ask before you've proven value.

### Q: What if a rancher doesn't know anyone to refer?
**A:** That's fine. Thank them anyway and say, "If anyone comes to mind down the road, let me know." No pressure.

### Q: What if a referred rancher doesn't onboard?
**A:** The referring rancher still gets credit for trying. Update them and explain the referred rancher wasn't a fit (timing, logistics, etc.). Keep the relationship positive.

### Q: Should I offer cash bonuses?
**A:** No. Cash bonuses feel transactional and cheapen the relationship. Operational benefits (priority, guarantees, premiums) align incentives better.

### Q: How many referrals should I expect per rancher?
**A:** Industry average is 1.5-2.5 over the lifetime of the relationship. Not every rancher will refer—focus on the 40-60% who do.

### Q: What if a rancher refers a competitor or unsuitable lead?
**A:** Thank them, follow up with the lead professionally, and explain (gently) why it's not a fit. Use it as a teaching moment: "We're looking for independent ranchers selling X+ head within Y miles of our hub."
