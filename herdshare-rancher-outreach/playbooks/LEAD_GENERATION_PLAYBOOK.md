# HerdShare — Rancher Lead Generation Playbook

## Purpose

This playbook provides a step-by-step system for identifying, qualifying, and sourcing independent cattle rancher prospects for HerdShare's supply infrastructure.

**Goal:** Build a pipeline of 50-100 qualified rancher leads per region, prioritized by fit and proximity to processing hubs.

## Channel 1: Public Data Sources (Foundation)

### Objective
Build the initial rancher database using publicly available directories and records.

### Sources

#### 1.1 State Cattlemen Associations
- **What:** Official membership directories and contact lists
- **Where to find:**
  - State Cattlemen Association websites (e.g., Texas & Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, Colorado Cattlemen's Association)
  - Annual convention attendee lists
  - Regional chapter meetings
- **Data to capture:** Name, ranch name, location, contact info
- **Estimated leads per state:** 100-500

#### 1.2 USDA Directories
- **NASS (National Agricultural Statistics Service):** County-level cattle inventory data
- **FSA (Farm Service Agency):** Producer lists (may require FOIA request)
- **NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Service):** Conservation program participants
- **Estimated leads:** High volume, but requires filtering

#### 1.3 Livestock Auction Listings
- **What:** Ranchers who regularly consign cattle to auctions
- **Where to find:**
  - Local auction barn websites (Joplin Regional Stockyards, Billings Livestock Commission, etc.)
  - Auction results and consignor lists
  - Printed sale catalogs
- **Data to capture:** Consignor name, lot size, frequency
- **Estimated leads per auction:** 50-200 active consignors

#### 1.4 County Agricultural Extension Offices
- **What:** County agents maintain relationships with local producers
- **Strategy:**
  - Call county extension agents directly
  - Explain HerdShare as a buyer opportunity (not competition)
  - Ask for introductions to ranchers looking for contracts
- **Estimated leads per county:** 10-30 qualified referrals

#### 1.5 Cooperative and Processor Referral Lists
- **What:** Regional cooperatives and small processors know independent ranchers
- **Strategy:**
  - Position HerdShare as complementary (we create additional demand)
  - Ask for referrals to ranchers with excess capacity
  - Build partnership where we both benefit
- **Estimated leads per cooperative:** 20-50

---

## Channel 2: Digital Platforms (Scale)

### Objective
Identify ranchers who are digitally active and potentially more open to new partnerships.

### Sources

#### 2.1 Facebook Groups (Primary Digital Channel)
**Target groups:**
- State/regional ranching groups (e.g., "Nebraska Ranchers Network")
- Cattle operation groups (e.g., "Commercial Cow-Calf Producers")
- Agricultural business groups
- Livestock marketing groups

**Strategy:**
- Join groups as HerdShare representative (transparent, not undercover)
- Observe discussions about pricing frustrations, auction disappointments
- Engage authentically (comment, don't pitch)
- Direct message ranchers who express interest in alternative sales channels

**What NOT to do:**
- Mass spam group walls
- Use sales language
- Promise prices without context

**Estimated leads:** 20-50 qualified prospects per regional group

#### 2.2 LinkedIn (Secondary)
**Target profiles:**
- Title: "Rancher," "Cattle Producer," "Ranch Manager"
- Location: Within target regions
- Activity: Posts about operations, not influencer content

**Strategy:**
- Connect with personalized messages
- Focus on operations-minded ranchers (not branded personalities)
- Share content about supply chain challenges

**Estimated leads:** 10-30 per region

#### 2.3 Rancher Forums and Bulletin Boards
- **CattleToday.com:** Active producer forums
- **RanchWorld:** Classifieds and discussion boards
- **AgTalk:** Cattle production sections

**Strategy:**
- Monitor "For Sale" sections (ranchers selling cattle = potential partners)
- Engage in pricing/marketing discussions
- Private message interested parties

#### 2.4 Agricultural Newsletters and Classifieds
- **Beef Magazine:** Subscriber lists (may require advertising)
- **Drovers:** Trade publication readership
- **Local agricultural newspapers:** Classified ads (place "buyer looking for rancher partners" ads)

---

## Channel 3: Geographic Intelligence (Prioritization)

### Objective
Overlay rancher density with logistical advantage to prioritize outreach by region.

### Process

#### Step 1: Map Current/Planned Warehouse Hubs
- List all HerdShare warehouse locations (current and 12-month pipeline)
- Identify processing facility partnerships in each region

#### Step 2: Define Target Radiuses
- **Primary zone:** 60-100 miles from hub
- **Secondary zone:** 100-150 miles from hub

#### Step 3: Overlay Cattle Density Data
**Data sources:**
- USDA NASS county-level cattle inventory
- State agricultural census data
- Auction market locations (indicator of rancher density)

**Prioritize counties with:**
- High cattle inventory (10,000+ head)
- Multiple independent ranchers (not dominated by 1-2 large operations)
- Accessible freight routes

#### Step 4: Rank Regions by Lead Quality Score
Score each region 1-5 on:
- Cattle density
- Distance to hub
- Processing capacity
- Rancher independence (vs. corporate consolidation)

**Focus outreach on 4-5 star regions first.**

## Channel 4: Referral Flywheel (Multiplication)

### Objective
Turn onboarded ranchers into your best lead source.

### Why Referrals Work
- Ranchers trust other ranchers
- Peer recommendations overcome skepticism
- Referrals close faster and retain longer

### Referral Program Structure

#### Incentive Tiers
**For every qualified referral (rancher who completes first delivery):**
- **Tier 1:** Priority allocation during high-demand periods
- **Tier 2:** +5 days faster payment terms (e.g., Net 30 → Net 25)
- **Tier 3:** Volume guarantee for next quarter

**For 3+ successful referrals:**
- "Founding Rancher" status
- Annual supply planning session
- First access to new hub regions

#### How to Activate Referrals

**Timing:** Ask for referrals AFTER first successful delivery (not before).

**Script (in-person or phone):**
> "We're looking to work with more ranchers like you in [county/region]. Do you know any nearby producers who might benefit from a reliable buyer relationship? We'd value an introduction."

**Make it easy:**
- Provide a simple referral form (name, phone, ranch location)
- Offer to make first contact (don't ask rancher to pitch for you)
- Follow up and close the loop ("Thanks for the intro—we connected with [name]")

#### Referral Tracking
Log in CRM:
- Referring rancher name
- Referred rancher name
- Status (contacted, meeting scheduled, onboarded)
- Incentive earned

## Lead Qualification Criteria

### Before Outreach, Screen for:

#### Must-Have Criteria
✅ Independent operation (not subsidiary of large corporation)
✅ Active cattle operation (selling 50+ head annually)
✅ Located within 150 miles of HerdShare hub
✅ Selling through auction or local buyers (indicates flexibility)

#### Nice-to-Have Criteria
- 100+ head annual throughput
- Existing relationships with processors
- Previous experience with contracts
- Diversified operation (not 100% dependent on one buyer)

#### Disqualifiers
❌ Branded DTC retail operations (competing business model)
❌ Feedlot conglomerates (not target profile)
❌ Hobby farms (<20 head)
❌ Ranchers under exclusive contract (unethical to poach)

- Monitor forums for active sellers
- Add qualified leads to spreadsheet

### Week 3: Geographic Prioritization
- Map leads by proximity to hub
- Overlay cattle density data
- Re-rank by logistical fit
- Identify "clusters" (3+ ranchers within 20 miles = efficiency opportunity)

### Week 4: Outreach Launch
- Begin phone calls to top 20 scored leads
- Send follow-up emails
- Schedule in-person visits for interested parties
- Log all interactions in CRM

### Month 2+: Referral Activation
- Ask first onboarded ranchers for referrals

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't:
- Buy email lists and blast impersonal messages
- Use "innovative" or "disruptive" language
- Over-promise on pricing before understanding costs
- Focus on scale over relationships
- Ignore ranchers who are "too small" (today's 50-head operation may be tomorrow's 200-head partner)

### ✅ Do:
- Build relationships before asking for business
- Speak plainly and respectfully
- Listen more than you pitch
- Follow up consistently
- Respect rancher autonomy
