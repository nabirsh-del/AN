AD 01: FROM AMERICAN SOIL

This supply chain starts at the source. Independent ranchers managing American land, raising cattle without corporate oversight. Food infrastructure begins with who owns the ground.

AD 02: OWN THE SUPPLY

Direct distribution means controlling every step between ranch and delivery. No intermediaries extracting margin, no black boxes in the supply chain. This is what infrastructure looks like when ranchers own it.

AD 03: KEEPS DOLLARS LOCAL

When supply chains run through rural communities instead of around them, the economic impact stays regional. Independent infrastructure means independent economies.

AD 04: CLEAN AMERICAN PROTEIN

Beef raised on American ranches, processed through transparent supply chains, delivered at the scale institutions require. Protein infrastructure without the corporate distribution tax.

AD 05: WHO CONTROLS OUR FOOD

The supply chain is not neutral territory. Every distribution choice is a power choice. HerdShare exists because ranchers decided they didn't need permission to build their own infrastructure.
