# HERDSHARE × POMELE — PRODUCTION WORKFLOW

## BATCH 001 EXECUTION GUIDE

### STEP 1: Generate Images in Pomele

1. Navigate to **https://labs.google.com/pomelli/**
2. Set aspect ratio to **4:5 portrait**
3. Copy each prompt from `BATCH_001_POMELE_PROMPTS.txt`
4. Generate images one by one:
   - AD 01: FROM AMERICAN SOIL
   - AD 02: OWN THE SUPPLY
   - AD 03: KEEPS DOLLARS LOCAL
   - AD 04: CLEAN AMERICAN PROTEIN
   - AD 05: WHO CONTROLS OUR FOOD
5. Download all generated images
6. Name files: `batch_001_ad_01.jpg`, `batch_001_ad_02.jpg`, etc.

### STEP 2: Apply Text Overlays

Use design software (Figma, Canva, Photoshop, etc.):

1. Open each generated image
2. Verify aspect ratio is **1080x1350px** (4:5 portrait for Instagram/LinkedIn)
3. Add text overlay from `BATCH_001_TEXT_OVERLAYS_CAPTIONS.txt`:
   - **Font**: Helvetica Bold, Gotham Bold, Inter Bold, or DM Sans Bold
   - **Color**: White (#FFFFFF) or off-white (#F5F5F5)
   - **Size**: 72-96pt (test legibility on mobile)
   - **Position**: Centered or top-third
   - **Effects**: Add subtle drop shadow if needed for contrast
4. Optional: Add HerdShare logo in bottom corner (small, not dominant)
5. Export as high-quality JPG or PNG

### STEP 3: Prepare for Social Distribution

**For each ad:**

1. **Image file**: Final designed creative (1080x1350px)
2. **Caption**: Copy from `BATCH_001_TEXT_OVERLAYS_CAPTIONS.txt`
3. **Platform**: Instagram feed + LinkedIn feed
4. **Ad type**: Paid/boosted post (not organic)
5. **Targeting**:
   - Operators
   - Ranchers
   - Institutional buyers
   - Food service professionals

### STEP 4: Schedule/Upload

**Instagram**:
- Upload to Meta Ads Manager
- Select feed placement (not stories/reels)
- Set campaign objective (awareness, traffic, or conversions)
- Apply caption

**LinkedIn**:
- Upload to LinkedIn Campaign Manager
- Select single image ad format
- Apply caption (adapt if needed for professional tone)

## QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before launching ads, verify:

- [ ] Images are 1080x1350px (4:5 portrait)
- [ ] Text overlays are legible on mobile
- [ ] No logos burned into generated images (added separately)
- [ ] Captions maintain HerdShare voice (no emojis, no hype)

## NEXT BATCH GENERATION

To generate Batch 002, run the prompt framework again with these guidelines:

1. Avoid repeating scenes from Batch 001
2. Maintain even pillar distribution
3. Continue documentary visual language
4. Track used environments/compositions in generation log

Update the generation log in `herdshare_pomele_ad_generation_system.md` after each batch.
