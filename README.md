# Dr. Badhwar Intelligence & Response Platform

Production-grade monitoring, intelligence, and rapid-response platform focused on cardiothoracic surgery news, research, policy, and competitive developments. Built for a small communications team to operate with minimal technical support.

## Overview
- **Collection layer:** RSS/API/web/email collectors normalize raw content into a shared schema.
- **Analysis layer:** LLM-assisted enrichment scores relevance, urgency, and sentiment, classifies by category, and embeds against Dr. Badhwar’s approved corpus via vector search.
- **Action layer:** Generates alert-ready talking points, weekly briefs, monthly strategy memos, and quarterly reports, all routed through human review.

See `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/data_schema.md` for the full blueprint.
